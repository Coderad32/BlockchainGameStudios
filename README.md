# Welcome

Thanks for checking out the repo!
Take a look around make edits if you dare.

## Blockchain Technology Stack

- Smart Contracts: Solidity contracts for asset tokenization, provenance, and secure transactions
- Integration: MetaMask, Hardhat, and Ethers.js for seamless DApp interaction
- Features: Tokenized crop assets and logistics tracking
- Decentralized XTTPS XSSL certificate validation
- AEAD cryptographic primitives (ChaCha20‑Poly1305, AES‑GCM) for secure communication
- Containerization: Dockerized blockchain nodes for reproducible environments and easy deployment

## Game Studios

- Custom Engine: Modular Blam!-style engine prototype with physics, rendering, and scripting layers
- Tooling: CLI/GUI overlays for debugging, benchmarking, and extensibility

### Focus Areas

- Cross‑platform Win32 desktop integration
- Secure onboarding flows for multiplayer or blockchain‑enabled games
- Documentation and scaffolds for developer empowerment

## Merge Concept

- Blockchain + Gaming: Tokenized in‑game assets, decentralized identity, and secure session management

### Shared Components
- Service Agent for automation
- System Handler (Reference Handler 1.0) for protocol communication
- Webserver 1.0 for blockchain‑integrated multiplayer backends
- Vision: A unified ecosystem where cryptographic trust meets immersive gameplay

## Summary

• Experiment with blockchain protocols, smart contracts, and decentralized certification
• Prototype game engines and studio workflows with modular scaffolds
• Merge concepts into a cohesive framework for secure, ethical, and creative technology
• Document everything clearly to empower developers and collaborators
